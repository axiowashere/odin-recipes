                <li> 2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                <li> 1 teaspoon paprika </li>
                <li> salt & pepper to taste </li>

            <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Cut up your chicken pieces.</li>
                <li> 
                    Place flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking
                    dictate the amount of flour you use). Season flour with paprika (which helps
                    to brown the chicken), salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time,
                    transfer them into the bag with flour; seal the bag and shake to 
                    coat well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a 
                    clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A 
                    PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with 
                    vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken 
                    in HOT oil on both sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the 
                    chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat 
                    again, and continue to fry until crispy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drain fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, 
                    you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly
                    warm oven while preparing the rest.
